# --------- The FAQs (edit text freely) ----------
faq("What is a deepfake?",
    "A deepfake is a video or audio that has been artificially generated or manipulated by AI.")

faq("How accurate is VeriFace?",
    "We focus on **transparent evidence** (timestamps + reasons) instead of a single score. "
    "Our detectors are calibrated to be conservative in demo mode, and we show what each flag means.")

faq("What happens to my uploaded files?",
    "In this hackathon demo, analysis happens **locally** and files are **not stored**. "
    "If you deploy to a server later, update the Privacy page with your storage policy.")

faq("Does it work on all types of videos?",
    "Best on **talking-head** clips with clear face and audible speech. "
    "Fast cuts, music, heavy noise, or tiny faces can reduce reliability.")

faq("How long does the analysis take?",
    "Typically **5–30 seconds** for short clips (depends on CPU/GPU and clip length).")

faq("Can I use the results in court or investigations?",
    "Treat this as a **screening tool**. It highlights suspicious segments to review. "
    "For formal use, pair with expert analysis and chain-of-custody procedures.")

faq("Is my data shared with third parties?",
    "No. In this demo, nothing is uploaded to external services. "
    "If you enable cloud mode in the future, disclose that clearly in Privacy Policy.")

faq("What does each detector look for?",
    "- **LipSync**: mismatch between mouth motion and audio energy.\n"
    "- **Blink**: unnatural blink patterns (e.g., no blinks for a long time).\n"
    "- **Voice**: spectral artifacts consistent with TTS or heavy editing.\n\n"
    "We combine them and show a **timeline** of suspicious moments.")

faq("What are known limitations?",
    "- Very **quiet/noisy audio**, obstructed faces, profile views, or fast edits can reduce reliability.\n"
    "- Detectors may be conservative and mark **Inconclusive** instead of forcing a call.")
